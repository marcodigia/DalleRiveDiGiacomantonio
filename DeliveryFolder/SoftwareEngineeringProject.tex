\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this project is to build a system, called Data4Help, that allows third parties to monitor the position and health status of users. The data are collected by TrackMe, the company that wants to develop Data4Help, and are shared with other companies which are interested in those data.
Furthermore, TrackMe wants to develop AutomatedSOS, a system build on top of Data4Help. AutomatedSOS is a service designed for elderly people, it is able to intervene by calling an ambulance if the health parameters of the user are below some fixed thresholds.
\subsection{Scope}
\subsubsection{Description of the given problem}
TrackMe is a company that wants to develop a software-based service allowing third parties to monitor the location and health status of users. This service is called Data4Help. The service supports the registration of the visitors who, by registering, allow TrackMe to acquire their data. Also it supports the registration of third parties. After registration, these third parties can request: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Access to the data of some specific user.
	\item Access to anonymized data of groups of users.
\end{itemize}
TrackMe also wants to develop a non-intrusive SOS service for elderly people, called AutomatedSOS. AutomatedSOS is build on top of Data4Help. This service is designed to monitor health status of users and to send an ambulance to the location of the user if some parameters are below some specified thresholds. 
\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item {[G1]} Visitor can become User after providing credentials.
	\item {[G3]} User can accept or reject the request of access to his data formulated by companies.
	\item {[G4]} If user's parameters are below specified thresholds, an ambulance is called within 5 seconds. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {[G4.1]} Ambulance is required at current user's location. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item {[G5]} Company can become a User after providing credentials. 
	\item {[G6]} Company can be recognized providing a username and a password.
	\item {[G7]} Company can formulate a request to see anonymized data of a group of users.
	\item {[G8]} Company can formulate a request to see data of a specific user providing his SSN.
	\item {[G9]} Company can see anonymized data of a group of users.
	\item {[G10]} Company can see data of a specific user providing his SSN.
	\item {[G11]} Company can subscribe to users' new data.
	\item {[G12]} TrackMe can anonymize data.
	\item {[G14]} TrackMe can forward companies' requests to users. 
	\item {[G16]} ??? TrackMe able to withdraw a company ????
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Document structure}
\begin{description}
	\item [Introduction] gives an introduction to the problem and describe the purpose of Data4Help and AutomatedSOS. It also contains the goals that these systems-to-be must be able to deliver to users and third party companies.
	\item [Overall Description] gives an overview of the functions that the systems-to-be are able to deliver to users and third parties. In this section, users of the systems-to-be, are better identified, i.e. the kind of users that interact with Data4Help and AutomatedSOS. Due to the imprecise nature of natural language used in the specification of the project, a more formal presentation of the assumption is required. Assumption used by Data4Help and AutomatedSOS are presented in this section. 
	\item [Specific Requirements]
	\item [Formal Analysis Using Alloy] includes the Alloy model and the discussion of its purpose. Also, a world generated by this model is shown.
	\item [Effort Spent] shows the effort spent by each group member while working on this project.
	\item [Resources] includes the reference documents. 
\end{description}
\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product perspective}
Data4Help and AutomatedSOS are intended as a background application that are installed inside a smart watch. The systems-to-be acquire data of the users through the smart watch. The user register himself for Data4Help on the website page that TrackMe provide for this application. Users access to the web page through their Google or Apple account. These accounts are used by TrackMe in order to understand from which devices it will acquire data.
\subsection{Product functions}
Considering all the goals previously presented, we can sum up into four categories the main functions of the product:
\subsubsection{Acquisition of users' data}
Data4Help runs on a smartwatch, assumed to be able to communicate the data directly to TrackMe's servers. It means that this product works only with smartwatch with an internet connection. Future updates will enable to use also smartwatch without internet connection to run Data4Help and AutomatedSOS.
\subsubsection{Company access to users' data}
Data4Help enables companies to access data of a specific user or of groups of users. Companies access to these data through the web page. Data are shown in a user-friendly way, generating automatically graphs. Some samples of the GUI will be shown in the corresponding section.
\subsubsection{Forwarding of following requests directly to the users and data anoymization}
Companies are able to send following requests, in order to access user data. Data4Help allows TrackMe to put in contact companies and users. Every time that a company request to access some data, Data4Help notfies TrackMe's servers. Analizing the request, TrackMe's servers will decide how to proceed:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item If the request concerns a specific user, TrackMe sends an email to the user asking to accept or reject it
\item If the request concerns a group of users, anonymizes the corresponding data 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{AutomatedSOS}
While registering Data4Help, the user is asked to submit his age. Basing on some creteria chosen from the managment, a value \emph{Age} is chosen. If the user's age is greater than \emph{Age} AutomatedSOS is activated automatically. AutomatedSOS is a service that monitors the heartbeat of the user and if it's lower than \emph{Threshold}, calls an ambulance addressed to the user's position within 5 seconds.
\subsection{User characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Visitor}: a person not registered. The only thing he can do is proceeding with sing up.
\item \emph{User}: a person passed through a successful registration process. His data can be tracked, he can accept or reject compaines' following request.
 \item \emph{Company}: an entity that can be recognised as a company. It can see data of a specific user or anonimous data of a group of users. 
 \item \emph{TrackMe}: the set of employees working for TrackMe and the whole hardware and software interfaces that interact with Data4Help and AutomatedSOS.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumption, dependencies and constraints}
\subsubsection{Domain assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item {[D1]} The user's email is already known by TrackMe.
	\item {[D2]} Only real companies can sing up as compaines.
	\item {[D3]} Only companies can see users' data.
	\item {[D4]} 5 seconds are necessary to send user location and call an ambulance when parameters are below the threshold.
	\item {[D5]} Usernames used in the system are unique. Users have only the username.
	\item {[D6]} Users position is determined by using the GPS inside the smartwatch.
	\item {[D7]} When the system shows the position of a user it means that the user is
actually there.
	\item {[D8]} During the registration process the user inserts his main data (height, weight, age, place where he lives).
	\item {[D9]} The user has the physical characteristics that he inserted in the system.
	\item {[D10]} Smartwatch connects directly to TrackMe and send the data acquired. Data4Help and AutomatedSOS run only on smartwatch with internet access.
	\item {[D11]} The user is able to accept or reject the following requests by clicking a button on the email that TrackMe sends to him.
	\item {[D12]} Every time that a user accept or reject a following request a notification is sent to Data4Help.
	\item {[D13]} Companies have a username and a password and they are unique.
	\item {[D14]} TrackMe is able to anonymize data based on the group request only if the group has more than 1000 users.
	\item {[D15]} Companies know the SSN of the user. 
	\item {[D16]} A company that can see the data of a single user or of a group of users must also be able to choose the option that allows it to see users' data as soon as they are produced.
